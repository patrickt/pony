<!-- This is still incomplete, since Pony is incomplete. But I don't want to forget anyone. -->

Pony wouldn't exist without the help of others. I'd like to thank them here.

* Professor Gabriel Parmer, who provided the initial idea, guided me through the project, and was always there to reassure me when I threw my hands up in the air. It is no exaggeration to say that Pony would not exist without his friendship and guidance.

* Benedikt Huber's [Language.C](http://trac.sivity.net/language_c/) project, which provided a wonderfully stable foundation for exploring how to parse C with Haskell. Without its excellent documentation, Pony's C parser would never have gotten off the ground.

* Roman Redziejowski, whose parsing expression grammar for C99 provided me with much-needed help when writing the C parser.
