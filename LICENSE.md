Pony depends heavily on [Filet-O-Fish][filet], © 2007-2009 ETH Zurich and Microsoft Corporation and made available as part of the [Barrelfish][barrelfish] project. Because there is no Cabal package for Filet-O-Fish, a version is distributed along with the Pony source code. A copy of the license is included in `Language/FiletOFish/LICENSE`. Pony has a number of additional build dependencies, specified in the `pony.cabal` file.
