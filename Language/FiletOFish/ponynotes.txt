FunAttr (in Constructs) could be extended.
FoFConst should become a data family, I think.
FoFConst maybe should derive Functor, if possible

Expressions.lhs is the sort of shit that has GOT TO GO.
Otherwise, people could just lug around FoF and 

class family PonyConstant where
  PonyConstant :: Data

Does runAlgebra need to be abstracted to the type-level?
