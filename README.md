Hello, and welcome to Pony.

This README is very incomplete, and it will be expanded later.
For now, please read the LICENSE file.

Pony has been tested under GHC 6.12.3 on Mac OS 10.6.
To compile and run Pony, perform the following steps.
    cabal configure
    cabal build
    ./runpony --ponyproj=<your .ponyproj> [filename]

As of this writing, Pony doesn't do much other than parse C. That will change soon, hopefully.
